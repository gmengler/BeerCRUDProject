With this application, the user is brought to the landing page where they can then click to view the current list of ten beers.  From here, the user can decide whether to add a beer, select a beer to view its individual page, or delete the beer.  Should the user decide to select a beer, they will have the option of editing the beer's information, or going back to the list of beers.
